# Powercord Utilities

Powercord Utilities is an automated Installer/Uninstaller for Powercord with added features written in Batch.

Currently supports semi-automated installation and uninstallation of Powercord, along with PowercordPluginDownloader and PowercordThemeDownloader.

It also supports manually installing plugins/themes with a github repo link.

Currently working on fully automating the installation of Powercord, instead of relying on the user to close/open Canary.
