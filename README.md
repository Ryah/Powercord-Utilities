# Powercord Utilities (Windows Only)

# NOT OFFICIALLY ENDORSED BY [POWERCORD](https://powercord.dev/).
## This is just a fan project to make the installation a bit smoother

Powercord Utilities is an (unofficial) automated Installer/Uninstaller for [Powercord](https://powercord.dev/) with added features written in Batch.

Currently supports fully automated installation and uninstallation of Powercord and it's prerequisites with Chocolatey, along with PowercordPluginDownloader and PowercordThemeDownloader.

It also supports manually installing plugins/themes with a github repo link.

## Todo:
  - ✔ Automate Killing/Opening of Discord Canary during installation @done(21-08-08 02:16)
  - ☐ Plugin/theme backup & restore
  - ✔ Automate installation of Git @done(21-08-08 17:25)
  - ✔ Automate installation of NodeJS @done(21-08-08 17:25)
  - ☐ Streamline Plugin installation
  - ☐ (maybe) Make main menu a keyboard driven GUI (DOSKEY possibly?)
  - ☐ I'm running out of tasks but I want this list to be more full
  - ☐ Find more tasks

## Notes
If you're going to modify this script, use Notepad++ with the OEM-US charset. If you save the file without this charset, the formatting will most likely break.
